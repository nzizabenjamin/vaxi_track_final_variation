###🧩 SECTION 1 — Project Overview 
##📘 Summary

VaxiTrack is a mobile-based solution that helps parents and community health workers (CHWs) monitor and manage child immunization schedules. It ensures that every child receives their vaccines on time and that caregivers are reminded automatically before each dose.

##🎯 Objectives

- Provide digital immunization tracking

- Reduce missed vaccination appointments

- Centralize child health data using FHIR APIs
